# Learn Kotlin/Native

If you're like me, you've known about Kotlin/Native for a while now.
Multiplatform development is becoming a buzzword you just have to know. But as
with every new technology rushing to an official release, it might be a bit
difficult to start. Perhaps the docs aren't as great, or maybe the examples
take too long to compile. Maybe you just don't know what the first step is. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

If the above rings a bell, you're in the right place. This website was created
with a very simple goal in mind - get your feet wet with Kotlin/Native. It
won't teach you everything there is to know about it, nor is it a complete
reference. It will, in layman's terms, explain what Kotlin/Native is, and how
to write a few relatively simple programs with it.

I sincerely hope you'll have a better understanding of Kotlin/Native once you
go through the tutorials here, and will have no problem staring your own
multiplatform projects afterward. If you have any feedback, good or bad,
please let me know! You can reach me either via

As with every new technology, things change, and perhaps some of the content
here will become obsolete, deprecated or (gasp) wrong. If that's the case,
please open an issue on
<a href="{{ site.github.page }}" target="_blank">GitHub</a> or - in the spirit
of open source - submit a patch. I'll be eternally grateful!
