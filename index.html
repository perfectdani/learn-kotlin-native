<h1>Hello and Welcome!</h1>

<p>
  Kotlin/Native is all the hype these days. But as with every new technology
  just before its official release, things are moving fast. The documentation
  might be a bit out-of-date, some of it is missing, and perhaps the code
  examples aren't as clear.
</p>
<p>
  This website tries to be your Kotlin/Native ELI5. It assumes you're familiar
  with Kotlin and Gradle. It takes you from a very simple
  <a href="hello-world">Hello, World</a> program to a slightly more involved
  <a href="hello-libcurl">Hello, libcurl</a> program, to the pinnacle of
  Kotlin/Native - a multiplatform project that runs Kotlin code on an Android
  and iOS: <a href="hello-android-ios">Hello, Android & iOS</a>.
</p>
<p>
  This website, including its content, is available on
  <a href="{{ site.github.page }}">GitHub</a>. You're more than welcome to
  report (or even patch) typos, mistakes or misunderstandings.
